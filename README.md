# RF-MultiwaySplit
Random Forest Classifier with multi-way splits


The Mushroom dataset has 2 classes (edible, poisonous) with 8124 samples,
each having 22 discrete features1 . Train and evaluate the Random Forest classifier of 100 2-layer decision trees with multi-way splits using Infor-
mation Gain with the size of the random feature set M = [1, 2, . . . , 22]. Uses 10-fold cross-validation

Data set: Mushroom.csv
